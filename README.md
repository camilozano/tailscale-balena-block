# calozano/tailscale-balena-block

Runs a [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) node on a Balena device

Fork adds Exit Node option for Tailscale

## Setup and configuration

Use this as standalone with the button below:

[![tailscale block deploy with balena](/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/calozano/tailscale-balena-block)

Or add the following service to your docker-compose.yml:

TODO: add Docker image for deployment

You'll need to provide a valid `Auth Key` to the `tailscale` service in the `TAILSCALE_KEY` variable.
An `Auth Key` can be created in the [Tailscale Dashboard](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/authkeys).

## Tailscale

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is described as a secure network that just works.
It uses [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) to tunnel traffic between hosts.

## (Potential) Improvements

* Provide Docker image for the block
* Be smarter when TAILSCALE_KEY is not yet set in Balena
* Provide additional configuration options
    * subnet routing
    * ...
* Expose some tags in Tailscale?
* Expose some tags in Balena?
* Support kernel networking (instead of just userspace; also see [hslatman/tailscale-balena-rpi](https://github.com/hslatman/tailscale-balena-rpi))
* Some easy way for checking that Tailscale tunnel works?
* A way to refresh/reauth tailscaled state on command?
* ...
